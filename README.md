**CKCSM- CROP KERNEL COLOUR SIMULATION MODELS **# Corn Genetic Crossing Simulator

This repository contains a Python-based genetic crossing simulator for corn, allowing users to explore how different parental lines can be crossed to produce offspring with specific phenotypic traits, such as purple kernels. The tool includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using `tkinter` to facilitate the selection of parental lines and visualize the outcomes of crosses.

## Features

- **Genetic Crossing Simulation**: Simulate the genetic crossing of different corn parents to explore potential outcomes.
- **Phenotypic Prediction**: Predict phenotypic traits of offspring based on the genotypes of the parental lines.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly interface for selecting parental lines and visualizing the results of genetic crosses.
- **Visualization of Results**: Display the outcomes of crosses, including whether the offspring have the desired trait (e.g., purple kernels).

## Assumptions

- Purple kernels are the result of complex interactions between multiple loci.
- Simplified genetic model with hypothetical alleles and loci to demonstrate the concept.

## Installation

To run the simulator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`.

```bash
pip install tkinter
